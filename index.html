<h1>Clay Pigeons</h1>
  
<h2>Michael Cera</h2>
  
  <p>I'm goin' down to the Railway Station, gonna get a ticket to ride Find a big fat lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet
And get along with it all
Go down where the people say "y'all"
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game<br>
And start playin' again</p>
